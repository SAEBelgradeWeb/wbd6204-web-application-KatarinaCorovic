# TSM


## About TSM:

TSM is an Expert system for Traditional Serbian Medicine (abbreviation for the name) designed as a support tool for doctors. This version is very simplified as it represents the first Expert system for Traditional Serbian Medicine, that is why the creator wanted first to test the basic version, and if prooved acceptable, it would be upgraded.

Benefits of a single Expert system used in medicine:
- Higher accuracy for atypical illnesses.
- It can perform better under stresfull situations, because it's a system and it always follows the same algorythms.
- It has all the patients records always available, doesn' miss out/forgets any item.
- Faster performance
- 

## Ð¢he main idea:

Here a user/patient is presented with three different forms that lead to the therapy. 
1. The first form is a type of anamnesis, with personal information required to fill, this way the admin/doctor would have enough information to conclude the best therapy based on the type of life the patient is leading and his/her occupations.
2. the Second form is Health Predisposition Questionnaire applied for users/patients all previous illnesses, level of physical activity, previous symptoms, health parameters such as body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate... 
3. The third form is the actual Symptomatic Questionnaire, where the patient describes his problem in detail. 

When this final form has been sent, it is being sent to the data. A list of symptoms and therapies has been entered previously on the admin page, and every symptom is an appropriate therapy match. This way when to form is sent, the user will get the appropriate medical therapy on the final page, 


## List of used technologies:

- Laravel 8
- Inertia
- MYSQL
- Tailwid
- Phpstorm

## Functionalities:

The project was installed in Laravel - version 8 and developed in PhpStorm code editor. Back-end solutions were provided and performed by using Laravel documentation (Laravel, 2021). 

For the design, I used tailwind by adding npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer, npx tailwindcss init extension in Laravel, which was optimal for this choice to simplify designm but make it attractive and fucntional.
Regarding JavaScript part, Inertia was used. Inertia is able to connect the fornt end back part via her adapters. The code is simpler and much cleaner.  
Three official client-side adapters (React, Vue, and Svelte) for the front-end part and two server-side adapters (Laravel and Rails) for the back-end part.
